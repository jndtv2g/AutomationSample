# Automation Scripting
This is a simple project on automation scripting for testing purposes using Java Selenium.

I actually utilize Katalon Studio even more, but I figured that creating this project would help me enhance my skills on scripting with Java since Katalon Studio is mostly "codeless" due to its web recording feature.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Java, Selenium, TestNG, Log4j

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

One of the optimizations I did first on this project was applying the OOP aspect of Java Selenium. 
I started coding this project locally with just placing all my code in a single main method.

After learning Page Object Model, I adopted it and placed all of my methods in another class, where I would just call those methods instead in another script, or the actual test case itself.

I then came across logging with Log4j. I figured, like Katalon Studio, my scripts should be able to display logs as well for most actions performed and even during assertions.

Afterwards, I incorporated TestNG as well with the main thought that I wanted to execute my test cases in one whole suite, similar to Katalon Studio as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I actually disliked Java during my college days because of how complex it was to me.

But during the course of my career as a Software QA Tester, I noticed that Java was one of the popular programming langauges used in automation, which is why I built up the courage to take on the challenge in re-learning Java all over again to incorporate it in my skill set.

Although it was daunting (and even now), I actually enjoyed coding in Java, especially when I see my scripts running and catching bugs.

This is one of the results of my eagerness to learn automation in Java Selenium and I plan on learning even more, especially that there are more ways to optimize whatever I code.
